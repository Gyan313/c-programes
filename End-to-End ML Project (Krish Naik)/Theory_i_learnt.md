### `find_packages()` and the `__init__.py` file are both related to Python package development and management. Let's explain each concept:

1. `find_packages()`:

   - `find_packages()` is a function provided by the `setuptools` library, which is commonly used
     for building and distributing Python packages.

   - It is used to automatically discover and list all the packages (directories containing Python
     code) within a project directory.

   - When you call `find_packages()`, it searches for directories with `__init__.py` files (which
     are indicators of Python packages) within the specified project directory and its
     subdirectories. It then returns a list of these package names.

   - This function is often used in the `setup.py` script of a Python project to dynamically determine which packages should be included when building and distributing the project. It simplifies the process of specifying package names manually.

   - Example usage in `setup.py`:

     ```python
     from setuptools import setup, find_packages

     setup(
         name='my_project',
         version='1.0',
         packages=find_packages(),  # Automatically discover and list all packages
         # ...
     )
     ```

   - By using `find_packages()`, you ensure that all packages within your project are included when you distribute your project as a Python package, making it easy for users to install and use.

2. `__init__.py` file:

   - The `__init__.py` file is a special Python file that is used to mark a directory as a Python package.

   - In Python, a directory containing an `__init__.py` file is treated as a package, and it can contain one or more Python modules (`.py` files).

   - The `__init__.py` file can be empty, or it can contain initialization code for the package. It is executed when the package is imported, and it can define variables, functions, or perform any necessary setup for the package.

   - Example of an `__init__.py` file:

     ```python
     # This is an example __init__.py file for a Python package

     # Variables defined in the package's namespace
     package_variable = 42

     # Import statements to make modules within the package available
     from .module1 import some_function
     from .module2 import another_function
     ```

   - Without an `__init__.py` file, a directory is not considered a package, and its modules cannot be imported as part of the package.

   - The `__init__.py` file can also be used for relative imports within the package.

In summary, `find_packages()` helps you automatically discover and list packages within a project, simplifying package management, while the `__init__.py` file is used to mark directories as Python packages and can contain package-level initialization code. Both concepts are important for organizing and distributing Python code as packages.

Out "src" folder is containing the `__init__.py` file.For making all the folders in project a package.

#### what is '-e .' doing in requirements.txt ?

- The -e . flag indicates that you want to install the package in "editable" mode from the current directory (.). In editable mode, the package is installed in a way that allows you to make changes to the package's source code, and those changes are immediately reflected when you import the package in Python. It's often used during package development.

* This `-e .` will auto-trigger the setup.py file.

- So, basically when you do `pip install -r requirements.txt` than all your libraries in
  requirements got installed and when pointer reaches `-e .` , it will automatically goes to
  setup.py and run all the code there.Meaning `find_packages` , initalize project name etc.

- That makes this `-e .` flag so powerfull.
